# Updated 6-Step Funnel
1️⃣ Ad Impression – User sees the ad
2️⃣ Ad Click – User clicks on the ad
3️⃣ Landing Page View – User arrives on the landing page (💡 New!)
4️⃣ Add to Cart – User adds product to cart
5️⃣ Checkout Start – User starts the checkout process (💡 New!)
6️⃣ Purchase – User completes the purchase

# Use Cases
## 🔹 1. Real-Time Funnel Analytics (Conversion Rates & Drop-off Detection)
📌 Use Case: Track how many users move from ad views → purchases, and where they drop off.
📌 Processing Idea:

Use Kafka Streams or Flink to compute real-time conversion rates.

Trigger alerts if an ad campaign has a high drop-off rate (e.g., many people see the ad but don't click).

Send processed metrics to Prometheus + Grafana for visualization.

Example:

If ad_click → add_to_cart conversion is < 20%, send a Slack alert.

## 🔹 2. Fraud Detection (Anomaly Detection on Purchases)
📌 Use Case: Detect unusual purchase patterns (e.g., one user buying 50 items in 10 seconds).
📌 Processing Idea:

Use Apache Flink, Spark Structured Streaming, or Kafka Streams to monitor purchase velocity.

Flag suspicious transactions (e.g., many purchases from the same IP in seconds).

Enrich events with user location, IP, or past behavior to detect anomalies.

Example:

If a user adds 10+ items to cart within 5 seconds, flag for review.

## 🔹 3. Personalized Offers & Discounts (Dynamic Retargeting)
📌 Use Case: If a user clicks an ad but doesn’t buy, send a discount offer after 10 minutes.
📌 Processing Idea:

Use Kafka Streams or Flink CEP (Complex Event Processing) to track user journeys.

If ad_click happens but no purchase within 10 minutes, trigger an email.

Example:

User clicks an iPhone ad but doesn’t buy → send a 10% off email after 10 minutes.

## 🔹 4. Customer Journey Insights (Session Aggregation)
📌 Use Case: Identify which products users frequently add to cart but don’t buy.
📌 Processing Idea:

Use Kafka Streams or Flink to group events by tracking_id and analyze session patterns.

Detect users who frequently abandon carts → send them targeted offers.

Example:

If add_to_cart happens 3 times but no purchase, trigger a reminder email.

## 🔹 5. Ad Campaign Performance Optimization
📌 Use Case: Detect which ad campaigns drive the most purchases, not just clicks.
📌 Processing Idea:

Use Flink SQL or Kafka Streams to compute purchase conversion per campaign.

Dynamically shift ad spend from low-conversion to high-conversion campaigns.

Example:

Black Friday Ad → 10,000 clicks → 50 purchases (0.5%) ❌

New Year Sale Ad → 5,000 clicks → 100 purchases (2%) ✅

Automatically shift budget to New Year Sale Ad.

🚀 How to Process These Events?
Apache Flink → Best for real-time aggregations & anomaly detection.

Kafka Streams → Lightweight, easy for stream transformations.

Spark Structured Streaming → Good for batch + streaming analysis.

Materialized Views (e.g., Apache Pinot, ClickHouse) → Fast queries over event streams.
